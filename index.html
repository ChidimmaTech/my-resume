        <h3>Design and Development</h3>
        <p>I started learning to code in 2007 during my Masters Degree programme
          in Information Technology. Over time, I have gained a
          wealth of experience designing and developing web applications.</p>

        <h3>Business Analysis and Project Management</h3>
        <p>Whilst working on web projects, I find myself wearing the hats of a
          business analyst and a project manager so I decided to add those Skills
          to my portfolio. In 2014, I did a professional training in Business
          analysis and in project management. I wrote the PRINCE2 foundation exam
           and excelled. Having been equipped with these skills, I work as a Business
           Analyst alongside being a Software Engineer. </p>

        <h3>Tech Blogger</h3>
        <p>I'm passionate about technology and this passion makes me want to always
        convey information about technology. I feel that everyone needs to be tech-savvy
      to an extent as virtually everything in this day revolves around technology.
    For this purpose, I decided to start a <a href="www.chidimma.tech">blog</a> where
  I share anything about technology, careers in tech, tech gadgets etc. </p>

        <h3>Public Speaker and an IT Lecturer</h3>
        <p>One of the many things I enjoy dong is public speaking. Because of my ‚ù§Ô∏è for public speaking, I created a
          YouTube channel where I create videos on various contents ranging from life in the UK, technology(of course ü•∞),
          education etc.<br> I am also an IT lecturer, and I teach IT courses in UK colleges and secondary schools. You
         can view my YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGER4dD7nWU1rkLVJgTZZYw" target="_blank">
